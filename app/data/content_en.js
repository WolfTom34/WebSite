        title: "AUTONOMOUS SURVEILLANCE AND THREAT VERIFICATION",
        text: "Our Maverick ecosystem provides a fully autonomous continuous surveillance service designed to protect sensitive sites. Through the intelligent coordination of our drone swarms via the Hive station, we ensure round-the-clock monitoring, day and night, with automated threat verification in case of an alert. As soon as a suspicious event is detected, one or more drones are deployed within seconds to assess the situation and transmit critical data in real time. This service drastically reduces response times while minimizing the need for human intervention on the ground.",
